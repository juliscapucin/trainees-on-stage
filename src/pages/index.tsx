      Are you ready to kickstart your frontend engineering career with a
      traineeship? For our frontend team we are looking for graduates or
      starters with a focus on creating the best experiences in the world. We
      are looking for versatile trainees that wants to participate in digital
      platforms used by millions of people. A trainee that’s ready to kick some
      developmental ass for our clients. We promise you won’t feel like you’re
      stuck on the set of a boring sitcom or a dusty office from the 80s. Why
      don’t you come to see for yourself? Please Note: to be eligible for this
      traineeship you are required to be living in the Netherlands/EU. During
      this traineeship, you will hit the ground running as if you’re the Usain
      Bolt of the frontend. You will be a full and indispensable member of the
      project teams. We will dive into the programming principles and work with
      HTML5, SASS, ES6+, React and GIT. You don't have to be able to code them
      all fluently yet, but being acquainted with some of these terms is a big
      plus. Of course, we like you to technically be in tip-top shape, but there
      is more to it: our front-enders must have a sense of design and user
      experience.  As a trainee, you’ll be part of the Technology Campus of
      DEPT®, which is our talent program that molds you into becoming the best
      of the best. Through professional training, interactive workshops about
      the latest technology, and intensive 1-on-1 guidance from the best
      developers, this program ensures that you won’t turn into the designated
      coffee supplier or have to start an involuntary love affair with the
      printer. You’ll work closely with our team of designers, developers,
      project managers, and other great folks who will teach you how to keep a
      cool head and keep your coding on fire. We’ll give you all the attention,
      feedback, GIFs, and high fives that you need to grow into a professional
      that stands out. At the end of your traineeship, you’ll have a ton of
      experience in this field and working with A-list clients such as bol.com,
      de Bijenkorf, Univé, and Etos. Oh, and a portfolio that blows everyone
      away of course. All jokes aside: we’re an award-winning digital agency
      that’s on the rise internationally, looking for nice trainees. Young
      people, bright heads, something with ambition and accelerating companies.
      We love talent, but we’re also looking for the perfect DEPT®-fit. We want
      to click like Lego or match like Tetris. In a completely professional way
      of course. Because that’s what makes everything more fun: from Monday
      morning meetings to Friday afternoon mixers and everything in between. We
      strongly support diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive
      environment for all employees. Ultimately, we are looking for a unique
      individual who is able to strengthen our collective. Sounds good? We
      thought so. Now go apply! Note: The traineeship will start in September
      2022. Working out a case is part of the application procedure.
